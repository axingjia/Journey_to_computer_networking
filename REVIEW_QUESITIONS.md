* Design and describe an application-level protocol to be used between an automatic teller machine and a bank’s centralized computer. Your protocol should allow a user’s card and password to be verified, the account balance (which is maintained at the centralized computer) to be queried, and an account withdrawal to be made (that is, money disbursed to the user). Your protocol entities should be able to handle the all-too-common case in which
there is not enough money in the account to cover the withdrawal. Specify your protocol by listing the messages exchanged and the action taken by the automatic teller machine or the bank’s centralized computer on transmission and receipt of messages. Sketch the operation of your protocol for the case of a simple withdrawal with no errors, using a diagram similar to that in Figure 1.2. Explicitly state the assumptions made by your protocol about the underlying end-to-end transport service.

*Mail Client 
The goal of this programming assignment is to create a simple mail client that sends email to any recipient. Your client will need to establish a TCP connection with a mail server (e.g., a Google mail server), dialogue with the mail server using the SMTP protocol, send an email message to a recipient (e.g., your friend) via the mail server, and finally close the TCP connection with the mail server.
For this assignment, the companion Web site provides the skeleton code for
your client. Your job is to complete the code and test your client by sending email to different user accounts. You may also try sending through different servers (for example, through a Google mail server and through your university mail server).
